# Rubiks-Solver
Rubik's Cube Solver Implementing Kociemba's Algorithm

This is an implementation of Robert Kociemba's algorithm designed to find solutions to any scrambled state of a Rubik's Cube.
This is written in Python, and after finding a solution for the cube, sends the string over serial to an Arduino board to control a robot which can physically solve the Rubik's Cube.
